                <h5>Dustin LeFevre</h5>
                <p>
                    I grew up in the foothills of the Oquirrh Mountains and developed a deep love of the outdoors
                    through a childhood of exploration. My mother always had a camera in hand, so it didn’t take long
                    before I was asking to borrow it. Soon I got one of my own and I was hooked.
                </p>
                <p> My passion for
                    photography and my love of the outdoors have grown together ever since and at times have bordered on
                    obsession that has shaped my life in many ways. I even met my wife Emily through photography by
                    purchasing a lens from her on the local classifieds. Any chance I get, I can be found wandering the
                    desert, looking for cool rocks and seeking conditions that make for unforgettable images and
                    experiences. I transitioned to digital photography early on, but I still enjoy taking my film
                    panorama camera out in the field.<br>

                <p>
                    Fine art photographer based in Utah, Dustin LeFevre has been named one of the best landscape
                    photographers in the world.
                    Nature, light, and color are all reoccurring themes in his work. Dustin covers much of the American
                    West Coast. Furthermore, he has expanded his passion for capturing landscape photos into workshops..

                <h5>Erez Marom</h5>
                <p>
                    I was born in 1980 in Holon, Israel, where I still live today. Encouraged by my parents from a young
                    age to pursue any artistic tendency, I started playing the drums at age 9 and have been an active
                    musician until my late twenties. I was also interested in academic studies, earning a master’s
                    degree in engineering from Tel Aviv University, where I later worked as a math lecturer. Nothing
                    prepared me for what lay ahead, and I had no clue that my world would turn upside down in the years
                    to follow.</p>
                <p>
                    It was sometime in 2008 that I first saw examples of the images which can be achieved with a DSLR. I
                    immediately decided that I have to be able to shoot such pictures, and bought my first camera and
                    lens. Fascinated with the tiny world of invertebrates, I started with macro - my first photographic
                    passion. A year or two later I started shooting landscapes, and this, together with my love for
                    travel, became a fierce obsession that changed both my private and professional life for good.

                    Landscape and travel photographer Erez Marom began his photography work in the tiny world of
                    invertebrates. Born in Israel, where he still resides today, he was always pushed by his parents to
                    pursue his artistic interests.

                <h5>Christian Hoiberg</h5>
                <p>
                    I'm Christian Hoiberg, a Norwegian Landscape Photographer living north of the Arctic Circle. Being
                    outdoors with, or without, a camera is my meditation. Bringing you along on this journey is a
                    privilege.</p>
                <p>My passion for photography started at the age of 15 when I bought my first camera. Just like most
                    people, I entered the world of photography without having an understanding of the camera, and
                    happily used the "automatic" settings</p>
                <p>
                    The winter season is mostly spent guiding photography workshops in the picturesque areas of Northern
                    Norway and along the Arctic Borders. This is a highlight of the year as I get to help like-minded
                    people capture beautiful images of some of the world’s most amazing landscapes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Christian Hoiberg tops our list of landscape photographers for his night photography, including
                    imagery of the milky way and Arctic circles. Additionally, his time-lapse photos of Northern Norway
                    are stunning. He splits his time giving landscape photography tours in Greenland and the Faroe
                    Islands.
